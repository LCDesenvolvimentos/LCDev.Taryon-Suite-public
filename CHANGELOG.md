## Development Methodology

This template was developed following our 4-step research methodology:

1. **Rigorous Theoretical Formulation**: Solid mathematical foundation for all implemented practices
2. **Controlled Experimentation**: Templates tested in different usage scenarios
3. **Academic Reproducibility**: Open source, documented and replicable procedures
4. **Practical Application**: Validation with real use cases in research and development

## Research Lines Represented

This template represents and supports our main research lines:

- **EffiQuant Nexus**: Framework for adaptive model compression
- **ParamSpace Bridge**: Interoperable mapping of parametric spaces
- **TaskTailor**: Automated generation of specialized micro-models
- **CogniFlow**: Modular architecture for AI agents with hierarchical reasoning
- **NeuroMimic**: Platform for neuromorphic models based on cortical circuits
- **ArchSynth**: System for automated synthesis of hybrid architectures
